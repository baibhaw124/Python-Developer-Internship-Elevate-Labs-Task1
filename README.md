🧮 Calculator CLI App — Task 1
Python Developer Internship — Elevate Labs
By: Baibhaw Kumar Upadhyay

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of Task 1 assigned by Elevate Labs for the Python Developer Internship.
The objective is to build a Command-Line Calculator Application using Python that supports basic mathematical operations.

The application runs inside a terminal and takes continuous input until the user chooses to exit.

✨ Features
➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
➗ Division (with zero-handling)
🔁 Continuous loop (menu repeats until exit)
🧪 Validation for invalid numeric input
📦 Clean and modular code using functions
